## LoE-Movie-Maker
A [LoEWCT] Server made for the making of Legends of Equestria Machinima

## FAQ

### Can I run a normal LoEWCT server with this?

Yes you can, but moderation will be limited to server commands, plus everyone will have every skill in the game, kind of not fun don't you think?

### Are there any editing and recording tools included?

No, you should get some yourself by googling or something. For recording, I reccommend Fraps if you are a total begginer or Dxtory if you want full control. Sony Vegas Pro 13 for editing, or if you want to go the VFX side, Hitfilm.

### Then what are these things in the tools folder?

They are tools to help you mod the game to fit your machinima's needs, such as changing textures.

These are the tools included:
* DisUnity - for extracting all of LoE's .assets files, including: textures (.tga and .dds), sound (.wav), music (.ogg), models (.obj) and other misc stuff like shaders and fonts.
* .NET Reflector - Allows you to go inside the game's Assembly files (.dll) inside the Managed folder and look at the code (C#), decompile the .dll or modify it.
* Unity Asset Editor - Allows you to open .assets file like an archive, allowing you to replace files such as textures, so you can get them working in the game (BACKING UP THE ORIGINAL .assets FILES IS HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED)
* LoEWCT-NPCCreator - a Javascript browser based NPC Creator made by [GeekyGamer14](https://github.com/GeekyGamer14), I redesigned the web interface, still in beta.

### Are you secretly developing new LoEWCT features in this repository?

Uhhh, no... no, toally not! .........

Fuck, you got me, but I will be moving them over to the [LoEWCT] remake [here](https://github.com/WapaMario63/LoEWCT).
