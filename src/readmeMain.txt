This is the source code for LoEWCT-0.5.2.6.

You need QtCreator 5.2.0 and MinGW (for Windows users) installed on your PC to edit and compile all this code.

Download QtCreator here: http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/5.2/5.2.0/

If you are using Windows select: qt-windows-opensource-5.2.0-mingw48_opengl-x86-offline.exe
If you are using Mac select: qt-mac-opensource-5.2.0-clang-offline.dmg (Looks like something that would work for the private server, so try and see if it works)
If you are using Linux select: qt-linux-opensource-5.2.0-x86_64-offline.run OR qt-linux-opensource-5.2.0-x86-offline.run (I belive either one should work, x86 best)

Download MinGW here if you are using Windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download

Open up QtCreator and load the .pro file in this same folder with it.

Enjoy making plugins and maybe making your own version!

### GUIDELINES ###

1. All plugin related things must be inside a plugins folder in this folder this text file is in.

2. If you are making your own version, YOU MUST give credit to both, me (WapaMario63) for making [LoEWCT] and tux3/mlkj for the original files. So don't better not remove the lines of code containing the credits when loading the server. EVER.

3. If you are porting this to a platform like Mac or Linux, PM me on ponyforums.net the compiled version for such platform with a download of it uploaded on mediafire, mega.co.nz or google drive. Only these three I will allow.

4. You are free to change anything, if you are changing anything major (or adding anything major) PM me in ponyforums.net.
