### GUIDELINES ###

1. All plugin related things must be inside a plugins folder in this folder this text file is in.

2. If you are making your own version, YOU MUST give credit to both, me (WapaMario63) for making [LoEWCT] and tux3/mlkj for the original files. So you  better not remove the lines of code containing the credits when loading the server. EVER.

3. If you are porting this to a platform like Mac or Linux, PM me on ponyforums.net the compiled version for such platform with a download of it uploaded on mediafire, mega.co.nz or google drive. Only these three I will allow.

4. You are free to change anything, if you are changing anything major (or adding anything major) PM me in ponyforums.net.
